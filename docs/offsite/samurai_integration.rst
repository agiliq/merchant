Here are the methods and attributes implemented on the ``SamuraiIntegration`` class:

* ``__init__(self, options=None)``: The constructor method 

* ``get_urls(self)``: The method sets the url to which the token is sent
  after the it is obtained from Samurai. This method is generally mapped 
  directly in the ``urls.py``.

  .. code::

     from billing import get_integration

     samurai = get_integration("samurai")

     urlpatterns += patterns('',
        (r'^samurai/', include(samurai_obj.urls)),
     )

* ``transaction(self, request)``: The view method that recieves the
token   

* ``generate_form(self)``: The method that generates and returns the form (present in 
  ``billing.forms.samurai_forms``)

       class SamuraiExampleIntegration(SamuraiIntegration):
           class transaction(self, request):
               # The token is received in the POST request
               resp = self.samurai_gateway.purchase(100, request.POST["payment_method_token"])
	       if resp["status"] == "SUCCESS":
                   # Redirect if the transaction is successful
                   ...
               else:
                   # Transaction failed
                   ...


    In the views.py::

       samurai_obj = get_integration("samurai_example")
       return render_to_response("some_template.html", 
                               {"samurai_obj": samurai_obj},
                                context_instance=RequestContext(request))

   In the urls.py::

      samurai_obj = get_integration("samurai_example")

         (r'^samurai/', include(samurai_obj.urls)),
      )
      
   In the template::
