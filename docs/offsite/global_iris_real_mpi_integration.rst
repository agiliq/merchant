 Global Iris RealMPI
=====================

Global Iris RealMPI is an implementation of “3D Secure” that goes hand-in-hand
with the :doc:`Global Iris RealAuth gateway </gateways/global_iris_gateway>`
implementation. It is possible to use the gateway without the integration,
and in fact that has to be done in for some card types.

“3D secure” (better known by the branded services such as “Verified by Visa” and
“SecureCard”) is a service which helps to reduce the problem of online card
fraud (especially fraudulent chargebacks) by getting the customer to authorize
the use of a card via the card provider's own website.

Please see the `Global Iris docs <https://resourcecentre.globaliris.com/>`_ for
more information.

A summary of the full workflow looks like this:

1. At checkout, the user fills in their credit card details and presses "Pay" or
   "Buy" etc.

2. Your website uses this integration implementation to send a
   ‘3DS-Verifyenrolled’ request to the Global Iris RealMPI service. The service
   will return a response indicating:

   * whether the card issuer has a 3D Secure implementation. If they do, the URL
     of that service will be provided.

   * whether the card user is enrolled in the 3D Secure service.

3. Assuming there is a 3D Secure service and the card user is enrolled, your
   website returns a response that contains a form. This form is targetted at
   the URL provided in step 2, and auto-submits itself, taking the user to the
   card issuer's 3D Secure site (e.g. Verified by Visa). The form includes data
   relevant to the transaction (including card details and the amount etc.), and
   also a return URL that you must provide (the ‘TermURL’). You will also need
   to provide some custom 'merchant data' that will be passed back, so that you
   can continue the process in step 5.

4. The user enters authentication details at the card issuer's site (e.g. parts
   of a password) and hits submit.

5. The card issuer's site returns the user to your website, to the URL you
   specified in step 3, along with some POST data indicating the status of the
   authentication attempt. (The 'PaRes' data plus the 'merchant data' you supplied
   in step 3).

6. Using the integration implementation, your website sends another request to the
   RealMPI service to verify the information POSTed in step 5 (since it is possible for
   the user to tamper with this data).

7. If everything is OK, your website proceeds to use the Global Iris gateway to make
   the purchase. If there was an error, you will need to display an error message
   to the user and give them the opportunity to try again.

Many of these steps require custom code and views, but the integration does
the heavy lifting of implementing the Real MPI spec.

Also, at various points there might be errors and shortcuts, so the full process
is more complex. A full example is below. It assumes you are able to store
order details etc. in some way. You will also need to be able to generate unique
transaction IDs for each attempt at authentication. The best way is to create
some kind of 'pending payment' model that is related to your order model.

Example:
--------

This example assumes you are using the messages framework, and will display
messages on the payment page. This simplifies some of the flows. Bits of code
that you need to implement are marked TODO.
