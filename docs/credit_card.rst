Credit Card
------------

The `CreditCard` class is a helper class with some useful methods mainly for
validation. This class is available in `billing.utils.credit_card`.

Attribute Reference
--------------------

* `regexp`: The compiled regular expression that matches all card numbers for 
  the card issuing authority. For the `CreditCard` class, this is `None`. It 
  is overridden by subclasses.
* `card_type`: Points to a one of `CreditCard`'s subclasses. This attribute is
  set by the `validate_card` method of the selected gateway.
* `card_name`: Card issuing authority name. Generally not required, but some
  gateways expect the user to figure out the credit card type to send  with 
  the requests.

Method Reference
-----------------

* `__init__`: This method expects 6 keyword arguments. They are

  * `first_name`: The first name of the credit card holder.
  * `last_name`: The last name of the credit card holder.
  * `cardholders_name`: The full name of the credit card holder, as an
    alternative to supplying `first_name` and `last_name`.
  * `month`: The expiration month of the credit card as an integer. **Required**
  * `year`: The expiration year of the credit card as an integer. **Required**
  * `number`: The credit card number (generally 16 digits). **Required**
  * `verification_value`: The card security code (CVV2). **Required**
* `is_luhn_valid`: Checks the validity of the credit card number by using the 
  `Luhn's algorithm` and returns a boolean. This method takes no arguments.
* `is_expired`: Checks if the expiration date of the card is beyond today and
  returns a boolean. This method takes no arguments.
* `valid_essential_attributes`: Verifies if all the 6 arguments provided to the
  `__init__` method are filled and returns a boolean.
* `is_valid`: Checks the validity of the card by calling the `is_luhn_valid`, 
  `is_expired` and `valid_essential_attributes` method and returns a boolean.
  This method takes no arguments.
* `expire_date`: Returns the card expiry date in the "MM-YYYY" format. This is
  also available as a property.
* `name`: Returns the full name of the credit card holder by concatenating the
   `first_name` and `last_name`. This is also available as a property.

Subclasses
----------

Normally you do not use the subclasses directly. Instead, you use `CreditCard`,
and call gateway.validate_card() which will add a `card_type` attribute which is
the subclass.
