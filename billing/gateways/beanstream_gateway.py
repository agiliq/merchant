        ("requestType", True), # BACKEND Enter requestType=BACKEND for the recommended server to server integration method. Note that server to server typically cannot be used when hosting forms in the Beanstream Secure Webspace.
        ("merchant_id", True), # 9-digits Beanstream assigns one merchant ID number for each processing currency. Include the 9-digit Beanstream ID number here. Additional accounts may also have been issued for special services. Complete one full integration for each of the merchant IDs issued.
        ("trnOrderNumber", False), # but Recommended 30 alphanumeric (a/n) characters Include a unique order reference number if desired. If no number is passed, Beanstream will place the default transaction identification number (trnId) in this field. Custom order numbers will be used in duplicate transaction error checking. Order numbers are also required for Server to Server transaction queries. Integrators that wish to use the query function should pass custom values.
        ("trnAmount", True), # In the format 0.00. Max 2 decimal places. Max 9 digits total. This is the total dollar value of the purchase. This should represent the total of all taxes, shipping charges and other product/service costs as applicable.

        ("errorPage", True), # URL (encoded). Max 128 a/n characters. Not for use with server to server integrations. If a standard transaction request contains errors in billing or credit card information, the customer's browser will be re-directed to this page. Error messages will prompt the user to correct their data.
        ("approvedPage", False), # URL (encoded). Unlimited a/n characters. Beanstream provides default approved or declined transaction pages. For a seamless transaction flow, design unique pages and specify the approved transaction redirection URL here.

        ("vbvEnabled", False), # 1 digit When VBV service has been activated, Beanstream will attempt VBV authentication on all transactions. Use this variable to override our default settings and process VBV on selected transactions only. Pass vbvEnabled=1 to enable VBV authentication with an order. Pass vbvEnabled=0 to bypass VBV authentication on specific orders.
        ("scEnabled", False), # 1 digit When SecureCode service has been activated, Beanstream will attempt SC authentication on all transactions. Use this variable to override our default settings and process SC on selected transactions only. Pass scEnabled=1 to enable SC authentication with an order. Pass scEnabled=0 to bypass SC authentication on specific orders.

        ("SecureXID", True), # 20 digits Include the 3D secure transaction identifier as issued by the bank following VBV or SecureCode authentication.
